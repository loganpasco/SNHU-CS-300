### MODULE 8: Journal

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

One of my goals was to develop a tool that would allow computer science advisors at ABCU to more easily view and manage their students' academic schedules. The program would use algorithms and data structures to quickly sift through the given prerequisite course list.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. 

To find a solution, I put myself in the shoes of a buyer. We use technology to hasten procedures that would have otherwise taken a lot of time to plan and implement. Effectiveness, efficiency, and speed are highly regarded in this community. Despite the fact that this project's initial scope was so little, you should nonetheless think about how to grow it. Obviously, there are many courses available in the real world, and in certain cases, the course catalog's prerequisites may change to reflect developments in industry standards. Choosing the right data structure is crucial for the effective management of data storage and retrieval.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? 

When I was stuck, I looked for answers on StackOverflow, consulted my teacher, and finally used Google. Imposter syndrome was by far my largest problem. Despite using resources like Code Academy and Khan Academy, I realized that my knowledge of the material was rather sketchy. I should practice critical thinking since questioning my established processes often results in novel approaches to old problems.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? 

Working on this project has taught me that good design is about more than simply how a page looks; it also has to take into account how much memory it will take up and how efficient it will be. I never gave much thought to performance or how to approach algorithmic design until I read about the big-O analysis and its implications. Also, this experience highlighted the fact that I lack recursive thinking, which is a flaw in many of my potential design solutions.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

Working on this project has made me rethink some of my other endeavors. I've been giving a lot of thought to the framework of my project as well as its aesthetics.  I think all of these elements come from practice. I have written enough file streams that I now have a common function  that I use as a prototype. I might even take a few of some other elements I keep reusing and develop them in to libraries.
